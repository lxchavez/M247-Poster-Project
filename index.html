          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
          Markov Chains are one of the most widely used applications of Linear Algebra.  It consists of a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. A basic understanding of a Markov Chain consists of a current state, often compiled into a state vector c, and a stochastic matrix P, an nxn collection of probability vectors based on the number of states (n). The current state is used for the basis of the future states. The resulting Markov Chain is thus formed where c1=Pc0,  c2=Pc1, â€¦  c(k+1)=Pck,where k is an integer.

          <p>
            In this presentation we will show how Markov Chains can be used to determine the results for a future event, and is reliable enough for many real-world processes, but may not always be the best method. 
Two such processes we will analyze here are weather forecasting and gambling predictions.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
          The Markov chain is a good application to predict the outcome of certain events, such as gambling,
          but not for all instances, such as weather. There are many factors that affect the weather:
          climate change, humidity, etc. It is difficult to determine the percentages of sunny, foggy, and
          rain on a current day, specifically finding initial probability vector. Additionally, as the chain
          for the weather is continued, it converges to a consistent probability which is not how weather behaves.
          However, gambling is a more contained system that is based on the stochastic matrix of the machine.
          The results show that the bid is higher, the probability to win is higher and vise-versa. Everything 
          is predetermined by which machine is used and the amount of money by the user matching the consistent
          probability of 99 trials. Ultimately, it depends on the consistency of the system that allows how
          accurate the Markov chain can be.
